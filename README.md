# Background
# In this exercise:
# First, company financial records were analyzed to show the total profit, average change in monthly profit, and the months with the greatest profit and loss. 

# Second, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. Poll data containing the candidate, voter ID, and county were analyzed to determine election results that contained: total votes, total votes for each candidate, and the winner.

# Skills used: basic python, read/write csv, for loops, if/then conditionals, arithmetic. 

# This challenge is part of the Northwestern Data Science BootCamp cirriculum.

The code in both the PyBank and PyPoll assignments were built using the class notes and exerises along with a few instances of chatGPT which were specified in comments for specific lines. The module 'sys' was found using chatGPT and used to print the output of the code to a text file. That portion was not mentioned within the comments in each main.py file.
